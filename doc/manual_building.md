## Preface

The _volumedriver_ code builds upon quite a number of (external) tools and libraries some of which are either not available, too old or require fixes on the current linux distro of choice (our default platform is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS). For these, we have a separate _volumedriver-buildtools_ repo that includes all requirements.

To build the _volumedriver_ you'll need to:

1. install all prerequisites
2. build the _volumedriver-buildtools_
3. build the _volumedriver_ itself

The code can either be built for debugging purposes (_rtchecked_ build) or as code to be run in production (_release_ build). In this document we mainly concentrate on the _release_ build process, but we'll hint at the changes needed for debug (_rtchecked_) builds.

Note: If you want a simpler, more automated way of building, do have a look at the [Building with docker](doc/build_with_docker.md) document. This document assumes you're familiar with building complex projects and using tools as, for example, git.

## 1. Installing all prerequisites

NOTE: while we try to keep this page up to date, it might get out of sync from time to time. The volumedriver-buildtools source repo contains Dockerfiles are guaranteed to be up to date for all our (supported) environments and are thus your best source to find all  required dependencies.

 You also need [Accelio](http://www.accelio.org/) installed, which we provide via our package repo:

         echo "deb http://apt.openvstorage.org unstable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ovsaptrepo.list
        apt-get update -qq
        apt-get install -y --allow-unauthenticated libxio0 libxio-dev

  - on __CentOS 7__

    Note: some of the required tools/libs are available from our own [repository](http://yum.openvstorage.org/CentOS/7/x86_64/dists/unstable/upstream/), so we'll add this to allow installing from there.

          yum -y install epel-release
          echo -e '[ovs]\nname=ovs\nbaseurl=http://yum.openvstorage.org/CentOS/7/x86_64/dists/unstable\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=0' > /etc/yum.repos.d/ovs.repo

## 2. Building _volumedriver-buildtools_

  - check out the source

        git clone https://github.com/openvstorage/volumedriver-buildtools

  - switch to correct tag/release if you don't want latest, greatest "dev" code. (Note: we're using the ["gitflow workflow"](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) scheme where development happens on "_dev_" and releases are tagged and merged into "_master_".)

        cd volumedriver-buildtools
        git checkout master ## or tags/<tagid>
        cd ..

  - create a configuration file that points to the desired install location and a path where downloaded sources will be stored
    This file needs to define:

      - INSTALL_DIR = location where build artifacts will be stored
      - SOURCES_DIR = location where downloaded external sources will be stored (if not already present)
      - PREFIX = normally subdir under INSTALL_DIR to keep _rtchecked_ and _release_ builds apart
      - BUILD_NUM_PROCESSES = the number of concurrent build processes (make -j)

    For example, create _my-release-build.cfg_:

        cat >my-release-build.cfg <<_EOF_
        WORKSPACE="${PWD}"
        INSTALL_DIR="\${WORKSPACE}/BUILDS/volumedriver-buildtools"
        SOURCES_DIR="\${WORKSPACE}/BUILDS/volumedriver-buildtools/sources"
        PREFIX="\${INSTALL_DIR}/release"
        BUILD_NUM_PROCESSES=4
        _EOF_

    Note: use _PREFIX="${INSTALL_DIR}/rtchecked"_ and _my-rtchecked-build.cfg_ for debug builds

  - set the VOLUMEDRIVER_BUILD_CONFIGURATION environment variable to this config file and run __build.sh__ to compile and install the artifacts:

        export VOLUMEDRIVER_BUILD_CONFIGURATION="${PWD}/my-release-build.cfg"
        (cd volumedriver-buildtools/src/release; ./build.sh)

    Note: use _my-rtchecked-build.cfg_ and _cd volumedriver-buildtools/src/rtchecked_ for debug builds


## 3. Build the _volumedriver_ itself

  - if you want to run the included testsuite, first read [running the included testsuite](running_included_testsuite.md) for extra requirements!
  - check out the source

        git clone https://github.com/openvstorage/volumedriver

  - switch to correct tag/release if you don't want latest, greatest "dev" code. (Note: we're using the ["gitflow workflow"](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) scheme where development happens on "_dev_" and releases are tagged and merged into "_master_".)

        cd volumedriver
        git checkout master ## or tags/<tagid>
        cd ..

  - use the manual-build.sh script in the src/buildscripts directory to build the volumedriver. This script expects the volumedriver-buildtools built as documented above. If you want to create an rtchecked (debug) build, you have to edit the script and change the BUILD_TYPE setting as per the documentation in the script.

        ./volumedriver/src/buildscripts/manual-build.sh

The resulting packages will be either under **BUILDS/volumedriver/release/debian** or **BUILDS/volumedriver/release/rpm**.
If you ran the including testsuite, take a look at BUILDS/volumedriver/release/build/test.log for the results (note: rtchecked subdir instead of release for debug builds).
